            <CovidP>
                Further to this morning's press conference from the QLD premier, masks are compulsory as a Condition of Entry for all clinics in Brisbane, including Northern suburb and Central Coast (effective immediately until 12:01 am Monday, May 20).

            <CovidP>
                This is in the interest of both our customers' and team members' safety, which remains our priority. Customers may remove their mask whilst having a face treatment e.g. facials, microdermabrasion, injectables. Face masks will also be mandatory for all staff.

            <CovidP>
                Our Medical Advisory Committee has also recommended that temperature checks are a condition of entry for all customers in our clinics.
            </CovidP>
            <CovidH2>
                Please ensure you adhere to these government regulations upon your visit to our clinics in these states.
